### Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager or just clone to your vim dir

```
# plug
Plug 'mootikins/wpgtk.vim'
```
You can then choose from two colorschemes `wpgtk` and `wpgtkAlt`, enjoy!

Also has support for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) and
[vim-lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim), with two included Airline themes and
one Lightline theme.

This fork includes `.base` files for use with wpgtk's template system, but require the use of
`termguicolors`. This disables live colorscheme updates, but enables the use of some plugins that
require `termguicolors`.
